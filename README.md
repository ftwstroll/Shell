# Shell
CSE3320 Operating System assignment

I took this course in the fall of 2018.

We were given shell.c and certain requirements that needed to be met.
msh.c was as far as I got. It is functional and it is mostly complete from what I remember. 
I had limited time between a full course load and an over time job. 
I have wanted to finish this but I have lost the requirements provided by the professor, so I am not sure
what I needed to finish at this point. 

This shell does provide the following: 
ls
dir
cd
lispids (list of pids created)
history (history of inputs)
